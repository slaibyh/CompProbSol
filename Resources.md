MATLAB
======

MATLAB is a high-level language and interactive environment that
analyzes data, builds models, and develop algorithms. Unlike Python,
MATLAB is much more "plug-and-play". MATLAB is a proprietary software
product, but it is free for Northeastern students.

You need to create a user account with MathWorks (free):

MATLAB help and documentation are ubiquitous:

Python
======

Python is freely available, but we will use several packages that do not
come pre-installed by default. For that reason, it is convenient to
install Anaconda, that comes with all the software pre-installed and can
be freely downloaded from:
[[https://repo.continuum.io/]{.underline}](https://repo.continuum.io/)

It is completely free, and the link to download is in the upper right
corner. It runs on all platforms, and the installation is
straightforward. The only reason why we are using Anaconda is because it
has a simple installer and it includes all the packages that we are
going to use by default.

The environment we\'ll often use is called \"python notebooks\" or (more
commonly) \"Jupyter notebooks\". Before getting into Jupyter notebooks,
I recommend that you watch Jessica McKellar\'s Intro to Python tutorial
at:
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkx5\_MRAV3A]{.underline}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkx5_MRAV3A).

As a follow-up, watch the Python lectures from the Advanced Photon

Mathematica
===========

Wolfram Mathematica (usually termed Mathematica) is a modern technical
computing system spanning most areas of technical computing ---
including neural networks, machine learning, image processing, geometry,
data science, visualizations, and others. The system is used in many
technical, scientific, engineering, mathematical, and computing fields.
Mathematica is another proprietary software program, but again is free
for Northeastern students
